Installation & Use
------------------
Copy and paste ‘Local Data’ folder to Tableau>Contents>Install>Local and change name to folder name to ‘data’.

Copy the 'Local Data' folder and its contents contained in this archive to your 'My Tableau Repository' and restart Tableau Desktop. Then select the appropriate geocoding role by right clicking on a dimension, going to 'Geographic role' in the menu and selecting the role that corresponds to your dimension. Then double click on the dimension to draw a point mark type map, changing the mark type from 'Automatic' to the 'Filled map' creates a filled map. Alternatively use 'Show Me' to switch between the two map types.

While the 'Local Data' folder is in your Tableau Repository you will no longer have access to the default Tableau geocoding data. To restore back to default simply move the 'Local Data' folder out of your repository or rename it. Then restart Tableau Desktop.

If you wish to redistribute a workbook using this custom geocoding pack be sure to save the workbook as a packaged workbook (TWBX) or go to File -> Export Packaged Workbook... in the main menu.
